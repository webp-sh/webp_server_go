[Documentation](https://docs.webp.sh/) | [Website](https://webp.sh/) | [Blog](https://blog.webp.se/)

This is a Server based on Golang, which allows you to serve WebP images on the fly.

Currently supported image format: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, SVG

> e.g When you visit `https://your.website/pics/tsuki.jpg`ï¼Œit will serve as `image/webp` format without changing the URL.

## Usage with Docker(recommended)

We strongly recommend using Docker to run WebP Server Go because running it directly with the binary may encounter issues with `glibc` and some dependency libraries, which can be quite tricky to resolve.

Make sure you've got Docker and `docker-compose` installed, create a directory and create `docker-compose.yml` file inside it like this:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  webp:
    image: webpsh/webp-server-go
    # image: ghcr.io/webp-sh/webp_server_go
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=1
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/pics:/opt/pics
      - ./exhaust:/opt/exhaust
    ports:
      -  127.0.0.1:3333:3333
```

Suppose your website and image has the following pattern.

| Image Path                            | Website Path                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `/var/www/img.webp.sh/path/tsuki.jpg` | `https://img.webp.sh/path/tsuki.jpg` |

Then

* `./path/to/pics` should be changed to `/var/www/img.webp.sh`
* `./exhaust` is cache folder for output images, by default it will be in `exhaust` directory alongside with `docker-compose.yml` file, if you'd like to keep cached images in another folder, you can change  `./exhaust` to `/some/other/path/to/exhaust`

Start the container using:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Now the server should be running on `127.0.0.1:3333`, visiting `http://127.0.0.1:3333/path/tsuki.jpg` will see the optimized version of `/var/www/img.webp.sh/path/tsuki.jpg`, you can now add reverse proxy to make it public, for example, let Nginx to `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3333/;`, and your WebP Server is on-the-fly!

## Custom config

If you'd like to use a customized `config.json`, you can follow the steps in [Basic Usage](https://docs.webp.sh/usage/basic-usage/) to genereate one, and mount it into the container's `/etc/config.json`, example `docker-compose.yml` as follows:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  webp:
    image: webpsh/webp-server-go
    # image: ghcr.io/webp-sh/webp_server_go
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=1
      # - LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2
      # - LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4.5.6
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/pics:/opt/pics
      - ./path/to/exhaust:/opt/exhaust
      - ./config.json:/etc/config.json
    ports:
      -  127.0.0.1:3333:3333
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 400M
    memswap_limit: 400M
```

You can refer to [Docker | WebP Server Documentation](https://docs.webp.sh/usage/docker/) for more info, such as custom config, AVIF support etc.

## Advanced Usage

If you'd like to use with binary, please consult to [Use with Binary(Advanced) | WebP Server Documentation](https://docs.webp.sh/usage/usage-with-binary/)

>spoiler alert: you may encounter issues with `glibc` and some dependency libraries.

For `supervisor` or detailed Nginx configuration, please read our documentation at [https://docs.webp.sh/](https://docs.webp.sh/)

## WebP Cloud Services

We are currently building a new service called [WebP Cloud Services](https://webp.se/), it now has two parts:

* [Public Service](https://public.webp.se)
  * GitHub Avatar/Gravater reverse proxy with WebP optimization, for example, change `https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09eba3a443a7ea91cf818f6b27607d66` to `https://gravatar.webp.se/avatar/09eba3a443a7ea91cf818f6b27607d66` for rendering will get a smaller version of gravater, making your website faster 
  * Totally free service and currently has a large number of users, this includes, but is not limited to [CNX Software](https://www.cnx-software.com/), [Indienova](https://indienova.com/en) 
* [WebP Cloud](https://docs.webp.se/webp-cloud/)
  * No need to install WebP Server Go yourself, especially suitable for static websites.
  * Image Conversion: WebP Cloud converts images to WebP/AVIF format, reducing size while maintaining quality for faster website loading.
    * Example 1: Original image URL (https://yyets.dmesg.app/api/user/avatar/BennyThink) becomes compressed URL (https://vz4w427.webp.ee/api/user/avatar/Benny).
    * Example 2: Original image URL (https://yyets.dmesg.app/api/user/avatar/BennyThink) becomes a thumbnail image using URL (https://vz4w427.webp.ee/api/user/avatar/BennyThink?width=200).
  * Caching: WebP Cloud automatically caches served images, reducing traffic and bandwidth load on the origin server.
